                I had started my coding journey fairly early on, when I was in high school in fact. I had decided to take up an AP computer science class. It was not much, but it was my first introduction to coding. That class gave me my first introduction to the coding world.
            </p>
            <p>
                After taking that class in high school, in college I continued taking some computer science/coding classes, although at that point I was only taking them for fun rather than taking them as a requirement, as at that point I was not really planning on making a career out of coding.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was planning on entering the medical field as a physician assistant. However, I was always intrigued by coding and eventually the alur of it was to much for me to ignore. So, I decided to sign up to Fullstack Academy, where I hope to offically begin my coding career.

            <h2>Hiking</h2>

                Hiking is also one of the things that I recently taken up. Again, in high school I did go out hiking with friends more often than not. However, after I graduated high school I stopped for a while. I was pretty busy with trying to graduate with a bachelor's in college that I completed stopped going out to hike.

                It wasn't until fairly recently, after a physical and mental health scare, where I finally decided to start hiking once more.

                Even after all the time that i have not been doing it, I find mself completely immersed in it. I find myself very relaxed and calm when I'm walking the trail and going along. There is something strangely relaxing being in nature. Hiking is one of the things that helps me whenever I am stressed or am worried about life in general.

            <h2>Gaming</h2>

            <p>
                Being able to game is something that I have always been appreciative of for a couple of years. I began gaming when I was in middle school and immediately I was hooked. Not only where the games that I played fun, but I eventually found that they also helped me deal with stress from either school or life in general. Gaming also was something that got me interested in coding, wanting to find out how games work and how they are coded to work.
